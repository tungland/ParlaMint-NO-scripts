## Qualified bicameralism
Norway has 3 parliamentary institutions in the period.

From 1814 to 2009 Norway had a unusual parliamentary chamber system. From its inception the parliament was consitutionally unicamberal. But as a concession to the political grouping that wanted a bicameral system the members developed a system where after being constituted the parliamentary body would divide itself in two sections. One ("Odelstinget") would act like a a lower house and propose legislation, while the other ("Lagtinget") would act as upper house.
